Here's a classification system with 10 labels for the construction-domain question classification model:

### Labels:
1. **Document Requests**  
   Questions seeking specific documents or information within documents like RFIs, specifications, submittals, schedules, or drawings.  
   Example: "Show me the hardware schedule for door 20110."

2. **Ownership or Responsibility**  
   Questions identifying individuals, teams, or subcontractors responsible for tasks or materials.  
   Example: "Who is responsible for caulking between countertops and cabinets?"

3. **Specifications and Requirements**  
   Questions about project specifications, product requirements, or standards (materials, finishes, tolerances, etc.).  
   Example: "What does the spec say about cabling for the fire alarm system components?"

4. **Materials and Products**  
   Questions about specific materials, products, or components, including their size, color, or installation details.  
   Example: "What color is the paint in the hallways?"

5. **Quantities and Counts**

   Example: "How many ceiling fans on 5th floor building 2?"

6. **Locations and Layouts**

   Example: "Where is the thermostat location in building 2 level 1 corridor?"

7. **Installation and Execution**

   Example: "What are the mounting height requirements for strobes on the project?"

8. **Testing, Compliance, and Commissioning**

   Example: "What are the testing and balancing requirements for AHUs?"

9. **Status and Progress Tracking**

    Example: "What are the finishes in the elevator cab?"

This system balances clarity and coverage, ensuring that most construction-related questions fall into one of these intuitive categories.
